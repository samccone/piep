## an education package manager

A [Bocoup](http://www.bocoup.com) project

`piep` is a package manager for educational materials related to teaching programming and computer science.  Creating good content for a class is the biggest bottleneck in developing good educational programs in these fields, partially because the content changes so quickly. `piep` aims to harness the power of the community to alleviate this bottleneck and produce relevant up-to-date open source content for teachers.
